# Kyrell Dixon Portfolio

This portfolio site was built with AWS and ReactJS to experiment with some new technologies around the AWS ecosystem--serverless in particular. The goal is to have a completely automated pipeline with a serverless architecture that I can iteratively improve on over time.

## Technologies Used

This is just a running list of all the tech that I have used to develop this portfolio.
